Polymorphism
1. What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
poly - many forms / moprh - to change - In OO, it refers to 'many forms'.

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
treat an instance of a class as if it is also another class/type at the same time.
Polymorphism allows for an  object to be of different types at the same time.

Super Class Shape - Child Class: Square, Circle

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
Interfaces and Inheritance.

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
Parent can be used as many times as needed, but a child may only inherit from on class.

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
Human behaviours (interface) to Customer Class  and Salesperson Class i.e Method to shake hands. Relies 


Composition
6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
Objects made up of other objects. There is a 'has a' relationship.

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
Example: A 'computer' has a 'battery' - each are a class.
The computer has ownership of a battery. Composition is used to flexibly connect a number of objects.

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
Flexibility over Inheritance.

9. What happens to the behaviours when the object composed of them is destroyed?
Everything is destroyed.
